Azure seems to have many more requirements to get a public IP that can be connected to than AWS.

This makes sense, Azure and Microsoft are known for being pretty security heavy.

This doesn't really work like it should (able to ping) probably because of a firewall/or because the VM doesn't support remote calls in quite the same way as AWS.
